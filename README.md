# Hamza
Hamza is a lightweight, fast and portable C89 [OpenType](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec) library.
It was written primarily for Arabic but [Unicode](https://unicode-table.com)/[OpenType](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec) are very general so it does work with other scripts. That is as long as you are not using special features which are not implemented for a specific writing system. Works well with Arabic, Greek, Latin and Roman writing systems. Han, Indic and Cyrillic writing systems should *hopefully* be supported soon.
