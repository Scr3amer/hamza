# Hamza
Hamza is a lightweight, fast and portable C89 [OpenType](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec) library.
It was written to be primarily for Arabic (Complex Shaping) but also supports Basic Scripts (Latin, Greek, etc...).
However I do wish it to support more languages and writing systems.
